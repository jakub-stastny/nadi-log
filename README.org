Log nadi dominance (ida/pingala).

* Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

#+begin_src
clojure -A:fig:build
#+end_src

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

#+begin_src clojure
(js/alert "Am I connected?")
#+end_src
